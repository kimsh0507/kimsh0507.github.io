Hi! I am a first year M.S. student at [DLI Lab](https://diyonsei.notion.site/) advised by [Jinyoung Yeo](https://jinyeo.weebly.com/). Previously, I received B.S. in Materials Science & Engineering from Yonsei University in Aug. 2024.

My recent research interests include: (i) **Reasoning and Planning** to solve long-horizon tasks and (ii) **Embodied AI** with a strong understanding of real-world dynamics.
Additionally, I focus on offering insights by **evaluating models or systems through new perspectives**.
The ultimate goal of my research is to design systems that enable humans to communicate and interact with AI in a trustworthy and beneficial manner.

**Topics of interest**
* Reasoning and Planning: [Think-and-Execute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02575), [RewardMATH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01729)
* Embodied AI: 
* Analysis of Models or Systems: [Preference Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13211), [Cactus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03103), [RewardMATH](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01729)
